      "message": "WRT tests subpackages, the requirements included in test-requirements are automatically added to a \"test\" extras option so we may use that in a +test subpackage. However, this would end up in a python3-foo-tests with the files and a python3-foo+test with the requirements which is not nice.\n\nTo fix that, we may move the files to the python3-foo+test package, although this would break compatibility unless we do a provides to -tests in +test subpackage.\n\nI still have doubts the effort of this is worthy or if we should apply a simpler approach\n",
